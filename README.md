# Project Elin Larsson Pizza Project

The assignment was to create a virtual Pizzera with prompts and confirmations about the user's order.

## The problem

I have worked with Javascript for a couple of years so I prefered to not use too many if-statements. Instead I used objects and a Switch statement. I tried to plan for it to have as clean and readable code and descriptive variable name as possible.

## View it live

I have deployed the project to Netlify and it can be seen using this link:
